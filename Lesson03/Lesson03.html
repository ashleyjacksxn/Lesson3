          <h3>Twitch Streamer</h3>
          <p>Twitch - Ashley Jackson</p>
          <p>02/28/21 - Present</p>
          <p>This job consists of entertainment and graphic design elements. I stream on Twitch.tv multiple days a week, including talks with viewers, games, and painting. Not only do I stream with unique attributes to my channel, I digitally create these unique attributes.

          <p>This job has allowed me to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Grow my network, connections, and community.</li>
            <li>Advance and challenge myself in knowledge of graphic design.</li>
            <li>Become my own boss.</li>
            <li>And be responsible for reaching my own goals and achievements.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Emote Designer</h3>
          <p>Ashley Jackson</p>
          <p>04/01/20 - Present</p>
          <p>When streaming I have create many connections and friends with other entertainers, most of which are also streamers. With this job I design and create custom emotes, sub badges, and screen alerts for their streaming channels. Each client gives me a list of what they are looking for, how many items they want, the personalized attributes they want incorporated, and specific detail of exact ideas if desired. I then create a sketch and send the ideas before finalizing and coloring the designs.</p>
