        <h1>Ashley Jackson</h1>
        <h2>Graphic Designer</h2>

        <p>My name is Ashley Jackson and I am 19 years old. I am from Wake Forest, North Carolina, and I am currently studying at Wake Technical Community College to earn an Associates Degree in the Advertisement and Graphic Design Program. Have been learning and creating work within the areas of Drawing, Photography, Digital Design, Typography, and Graphic Design. My main goal is to work within the Social Media industry side of Graphic Design.</p>
        <p>Other than my schooling and work I enjoy working with a few other mediums in art and have been working on my skills alongside Graphic Design. I enjoy painting as one of my main hobbies which I would like to incorporate in future projects as a Graphic Designer.</p>

            <h3>Twitch Streamer</h3>
            <p>Twitch - Ashley Jackson</p>
            <p>02/28/21 - Present</p>
            <p>This job consists of entertainment and graphic design elements. I stream on Twitch.tv multiple days a week, including talks with viewers, games, and painting. Not only do I stream with unique attributes to my channel, I digitally create these unique attributes. I use graphic design elements to create information cards on my about page, personalized emotes for my viewers to use, unique subscriber badges, personalized alerts to appear on screen, and more. </p>
            <p>This job has allowed me to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Grow my network, connections, and community.</li>
              <li>Advance and challenge myself in knowledge of graphic design.</li>
              <li>Become my own boss.</li>
              <li>And be responsible for reaching my own goals and achievements.</li>

            <h3>Emote Designer</h3>
            <p>Ashley Jackson</p>
            <p>04/01/20 - Present</p>
            <p>When streaming I have create many connections and friends with other entertainers, most of which are also streamers. With this job I design and create custom emotes, sub badges, and screen alerts for their streaming channels. Each client gives me a list of what they are looking for, how many items they want, the personalized attributes they want incorporated, and specific detail of exact ideas if desired. I then create a sketch and send the ideas before finalizing and coloring the designs.</p>
